# Software-Process-Improver-App

**iOS Prototype** app in Objective C which helps a software organization improve the quality of the software through proper communication, root cause analysis and tracking of the project.

**Used SQLite as a database for storing the data.**

**Three types of users**- Project Manager, Team Leader, Developer/ Tester

Each type of user has their different dashboard. Project Manager keeps track of the requirements, Team Leader keeps track of the listed Tasks and developer/ tester keeps track of the tasks they are working on.

**Project Manager** can choose team members from an organization to work on the project. He can add projects and list its requirements.

**Team Leader** can see the requirements of the projects and list the tasks for the developer/ tester based on that. 
He can mark the requirement complete/incomplete.

**Developer/ Tester** can see the listed tasks and can pick tasks from the list to work on. They can mark the task as complete/inconmplete.
They can create **Root Cause Analysis Chart**.

Project Manager can message Team Leader and vice versa.
